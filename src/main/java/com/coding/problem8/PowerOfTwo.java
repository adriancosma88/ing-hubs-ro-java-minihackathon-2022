/**
 * A positive integer n is given. The goal is to find the highest power of 2 that divides n. In other words, we have to
 * find the maximum K for which n modulo 2^K is 0.
 * <p>
 * For example, given integer n = 24 the answer is 3, because 2^3 = 8 is the highest power of 2 that divides n.
 * <p>
 * Write a function:
 * <p>
 * class Solution { public int solution(int n); }
 * <p>
 * that, given a positive integer n, returns the highest power of 2 that divides n.
 * <p>
 * For example, given integer n = 24, the function should return 3, as explained above.
 * <p>
 * Assume that:
 * <p>
 * n is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
